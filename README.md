This is a XJTLU SURF project led by Professor FILBERT JUWONO, focusing on developing a neural network model to estimate blood pressure. S-MAMBA was chosen as the model to meet the objective of this project. The code from https://github.com/wzhwzhwzh0921/S-D-Mamba/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file, was used as the fundation for our project and modifications were made to meet the specific needs. Hence, I sincerely thank https://github.com/wzhwzhwzh0921, for your generous sharing.
